    <b><a [routerLink]="['/products']">Products</a></b>

    <p>
      The products page shows a paginated list of all products with a search form. The filter form will fire when the
      user changes an input, but the search function makes use of the RxJs Debounce function to wait for the user to
      stop making changes - This means the api call to the server is only attempted when the user finishes typing for 1
      second rather than after each key press, reducing the strain on the rest api.

      <br />When searching for products and navigating away from the page and returning again, it will remember your
      search criteria.

    <b><a [routerLink]="['/product', 1, 'edit']">Product</a></b>

    <p>
      The product detail page has 3 tabs showing the edit form for the product, the stock holding for each store and all
      the orders for that particular product.
    </p>

    <p>
      The product edit form makes use of Angular Reactive Forms,
      <a href="https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms" target="blank">https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms</a>.
      <br />If you try and change the model year to before 2000 or after 2021 you will get an invalid form error and the
      submit button will be disbaled until the entire form is valid.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data for the product is loaded <b>BEFORE</b> the route starts. Sometimes this is done so the user doesn't sit
      on an empty page waiting for data to load.

    <b><a [routerLink]="['/orders', 'list', 'all']">Orders</a></b>

    <p>
      Orders page shows a paginated list of all orders, ordered by order date. The filter form uses the template-driven
      forms: <a href="https://angular.io/guide/forms" target="blank">https://angular.io/guide/forms</a> <br />The date
      range form field is using
      <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/datepicker/overview" target="blank">ng-bootstrap</a>, a third
      party module built by bootstrap for angular.

    </p>

    <b><a [routerLink]="['/order', 2, 'details']">Order</a></b>

    <p>
      An order detail page is protected using a route guard. Meaning you will need to login before you can view this
      page. Upon logging in you will be redirected the requested page.
    </p>

    <b><a [routerLink]="['/create-order']">Create an Order</a></b>

    <p>
      This is the most complicated page yet, it makes use of Reactive Forms, using validators, and cross field
      validation. You can dynamically add products to the form and calculations are made each time you modify a product.
    </p>

    <p>
      The page also makes use of a 'CanDeactivate' guard, which in this case, if you start an order and try to navigate
      away from the page, you will recieve a dialog to confirm you want to navigate away and lose changes.

    <b><a [routerLink]="['/customers']">Customers</a></b>

    <p>
      Customers page shows a paginated list of all customers.
    </p>

    <b><a [routerLink]="['/customer', 1, 'edit']">Customer</a></b>

    <p>
      When navigating to a customer edit/detail page, a dropdown list will appear in the header showing your 5 most
      recently viewed customers.
      <br />
      This could be helpful in a situation where you are dealing with multiple customers at the same time. <br />
      The dropdown list is making use of a Subject within the RxJs toolset:
      <a href="https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/subject" target="blank"
        >https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/subject</a
      >
      meaning that multiple components can listen to an output as an observable and watch for changes.

    <p><b>HTTP Interceptors</b></p>

    <p>
      The app using a HTTP Interceptor:
      <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor" target="blank"
        >https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor</a
      >
      which intercepts all http requests and responses and will show a loading overlay if a httprequest in progress.
      <br />There are many things you can do with an interceptor, for example you could cache data client side so each
      time the user requests the same data, we can just get it from the cache to save resource and time. <br />You could
      also add headers to each request to a specific URL.
    </p>

    <p><b>Auth Guard</b></p>

    <p>
      All pages other than the Home page are protected, so it should redirect the user to login page if they are not
      authenticated. Some pages will require ADMIN privelidges.
